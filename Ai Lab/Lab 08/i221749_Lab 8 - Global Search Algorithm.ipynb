    "### Simulated Annealing\n",
    "Simulated annealing is a probabilistic algorithm which tests points across a solution space to find the lowest minima. The algorithm is termed “simulated annealing” because it mirrors physical annealing, a process in which a material is repeatedly heated and cooled to elicit desired structural properties."

    "### Understanding Simulated Annealing\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to find the highest point on a bumpy landscape, but you can only see the area around you. You start randomly, moving around, trying to climb higher. Simulated Annealing works a bit like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Start somewhere:</b> You begin at a random point on the landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Explore:</b> You look around and take a step in a random direction, maybe up or maybe down. This step could be small or big.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluate:</b> You see if this step makes you higher up or not. If it's higher, you keep going in that direction. If it's lower, sometimes you still go that way, but sometimes you might turn back. This decision is based on some randomness and a special formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Repeat:</b> You keep doing steps 2 and 3 many times, gradually reducing how much you explore (like cooling metal slowly in the real annealing process), until you hopefully find the highest point you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The clever part is that sometimes, even if you're going downhill a bit, you might still do it because it could lead to an even higher peak later on.</b> Simulated Annealing balances between exploring new areas (even if they seem worse) and exploiting the areas that seem better. This helps in finding the best solution, especially in complex problems where there's no straightforward way to tell which step is the best."
