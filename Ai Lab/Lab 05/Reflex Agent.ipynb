    "A class is defined almost like a function, but using the `class` keyword, and the class definition usually contains a number of class method definitions (a function in a class).\n",

    "    * `__init__`: The name of the method that is invoked when the object is first created.\n",
    "    * `__str__` : A method that is invoked when a simple string representation of the class is needed, as for example when printed.\n",
